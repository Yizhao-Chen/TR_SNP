# Abstract: The benefit of using multiple species in dendroclimatic reconstructions in the eastern U.S. has been demonstrated. However, the benefit of including rarely-used species in multispecies reconstructions has been little explored. This paper shows the utility of using a rarely-used species in dendrochronology, Juglans nigra, in a multispecies Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) reconstruction at a site in southern Indiana.
